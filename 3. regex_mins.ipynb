Retain a consultant to design a community engagement strategy and messaging\\ncampaign. Staff should leverage outside partners, messaging platforms, and strategies in\\n\\nthis effort, as well as engage Council Offices and Commissions as channels to raise\\n\\nawareness in the community. The campaigns should be culturally inclusive and offered\\n\\nin multiple languages, with careful consideration given to the elderly population, the\\n\\nlargest segment of pedestrian fatalities statistically, and our homeless neighbors.5.

Any changes will not be implemented until the next Priority Setting session, in 2021.  \\n\\n \\n\\n(1) Alignment with Council Reorganization and Budget (a) Evaluate the desirability of \\n\\nestablishing a 2-year Priority Setting cycle. The process could begin shortly after the \\n\\nreorganization of the Council and conclude with the adoption of the budget. This would provide \\n\\nstaff with two fiscal years to accomplish the priorities. (b) Continue aligning the Priority Setting \\n\\nprocess with the budget process to ensure priorities are integrated into the budget. (c) Continue \\n\\nproviding annual progress reports, at minimum, coinciding with the Mid-Year Budget Review or \\n\\nanother appropriate opportunity. These may allow for minor modifications to the priorities as \\n\\nneeded.  \\n\\n(2) Strategic Planning (a) Explore opportunities to incorporate greater strategic planning into the \\n\\nPriority Setting process. For example, consider a 2-step process in which the Council first \\n\\nestablishes high-level, thematic goals, potentially with measurable outcomes. Then, the Council \\n\\nidentifies specific projects that would achieve those thematic goals. (b) Priority projects unrelated \\n\\nto the thematic goals may be added to the workplan if sufficient resources and staff capacity are \\n\\navailable \\n\\n(3) Assessment of Resources and Staff Capacity (a) To provide a more transparent and realistic \\n\\nassessment of available resources and staff capacity, include other ongoing projects in the \\n\\nworkplan that is developed through the Priority Setting process. These projects would include \\n\\nthose identified in the General Plan, Climate Smart San Jose, the Housing Crisis Workplan, and \\n\\nother major plans, initiatives, and programs that contribute to staff workload. (b) Organize priority \\n\\nprojects, including those identified through 3(a), by City Service Area (CSA).

The City Manager highlighted some of the great work being done by City  \\n\\n   staff, including the San José airport staff, for their great job in keeping travelers safe and  \\n\\n   the performance of efficient operations to ensure the public is safe. The airport  \\n\\n   technology team was responsible for helping all our employees that couldwork from  \\n\\n   home. The facilities and engineering team deployed safety measures throughout the  \\n\\n   terminals including deep cleaning facilities, installing plexiglass guards, as well as  \\n\\n   designing and building sanitation stations throughout the airport. The team helped  \\n\\n   maintain relationships and connections with all partners at the airport, including the  \\n\\n   Airlines and the Concessionaires. The Planning and Development team continued to do  \\n\\n   the work around moving forward with the masterplan approved by the Council in April.  \\n\\n   Also, the Marketing and Communications team did a great job of social media and other  \\n\\n   Forms by connecting with the public to instill trust and confidence that City’s airport is  \\n\\n   safe. The City Manager showed a short video clip of the City’s airport team effortlessly  \\n\\n   performing the operations to keep the airport running during this time.  \\n\\n \\n\\n   Deputy City Manager Kip Harkness and the leadership team from the City’s  \\n\\n   Emergency Operations Center provided updates including a focus on the City’s  \\n\\n   roadmap of ensuring compliance with the public health order, continuing city services,  \\n\\n   supporting those most at risk as well as an update on testing work with the county and  \\n\\n   where we are in terms of looking ahead at the reopening process. The City moved to  \\n\\n   Stage 6 of our Pandemic Response Plan, (Planning for Re-Opening of City Services and  \\n\\n   Facilities), earlier this month.  As Santa Clara County continues to ease restrictions  \\n\\n   under its Shelter-in-Place Order, he noted the Emergency Operations Center is working \\n\\nclosely  \\n\\n   with City departments to plan for the re-opening of City services and facilities that were  \\n\\n   previously shut down.  Stage 6 in the 10-stage plan is the City’s preparation phase for  \\n\\n   when more services and facilities re-open in Stages 7 and 8 of the Pandemic Response  \\n\\n   Plan progression. \\n\\n \\n3.1 20-695 Report of the City Manager, David Sykes.

The community want their voices heard in the  \\n   public dialogue we’re going to be having around IPA powers, Police Reforms, Planning  \\n   Commission, and other important discussions. Therefore, she sought clarifications on  \\n   community engagement process and the public's role in that process. \\n \\n   City Manager David Sykes and Employee Relations Director Jennifer Schembri  \\n   stated the City will explore ways to c get some input from the community.  \\n \\n   Mayor Liccardo observed that section 411 of City Charter deals with the City  \\n   Managers’ non interfering and administrative authority. Council seeks to be certain that  \\n   there is no language in City Charter, and/or nothing about passing an Ordinance that  \\n   would give investigatory authority over police misconduct case to the IPA, so that the  \\n   IPA don’t conflict with 411 in the execution of it duties.  \\n \\n   Council had a productive and comprehensive debate. Staff was directed to search for,  \\n   and/or look at the language in the Charter and if there is any specific language that  \\n   delegates the City Manager’s investigatory authority afforded it. \\n \\n   It was observed that the motion for this item has been made. Council resolved to move  \\n   on to other items on the agenda, with notation that additional time is required before  \\n   taking a vote. Council will return to the motion and vote on it. The City Attorneys will  \\n   check the Charter and ensure Council feels relatively confident there's no trip wire to  \\n   trigger a crisis.  \\n \\n   Upon motion by Vice Mayor Chappie Jones to table this item until later in the meeting,  \\n   seconded by Councilmember Maya Esparza, and carried unanimously, vote on the item  \\n   was deferred until later in the evening, with clarifications that Council will come back to  \\n   that motion.  \\n   (11-0.)  \\n \\n   Council returned to Item 3.5 with Mayor Liccardo restating review of the Charter  \\n   provisions and posing the question relating to anything in the Charter that would create  \\n   a contradiction or would undermine efforts of the Council to enact a muni code  \\n   provision that would empower the IPA with investigation authority. \\n \\n(Item Continued on the Next Page) \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n City Council Draft Minutes/Synopsis August 4, 2020 \\n\\n City of San José Page 13  August 4, 2020 \\n\\n 3.5 20-828 Actions Related to Potential Ballot Measure(s) for the November 3, 2020 (Cont’d)  \\n   Assistant City Attorney Ed Moran confirmed review of the Charter and see no provision  \\n   that would directly prohibit the granting of the IPA additional authority for  \\n   investigations. \\n \\n   Mayor Liccardo then clarified for the record that, whereas section 411 clearly indicates  \\n   that Council cannot meddle in the administrative matters of the City Manager without a  \\n   Council vote, Section 411 would not, and does not stand as a barrier to Council  \\n   enactment of a muni code provision that would invest the IPA with investigation  \\n   authority. \\n \\n   Action: Upon motion by Vice Mayor Chappie Jones to move approval, seconded by \\n   Councilmember Sergio Jimenez, and carried unanimously, Resolution No. 79659 was  \\n   adopted, and staff report, accepted.

Paul Soto stated that he had been to hundreds of hours of Council meetings.

Moto G stated that there is no respect for the public. Items 4.1 to 4.4 were supposed to happen after \\n2:00PM. It was pushed all the way to 9:00PM without informing the public. 8.  Lucia Garcia stated that we have to define what violence means, because I was in one of these protests \\nand somebody threw a bottle of water, that landed near the police officers. They attacked me.  9.  Bobby Gonzalez commented that nearly two thousand officers opening the substation hasn't been a \\npriority for a decade due to low staffing levels.  10.

Notwithstanding prior efforts, prioritize the most needed and most highly visible,  \\n\\n      high-traffic locations—those “sore spots” that have had the greatest impact on our  \\n\\n      residents’ perception of their community for cleaning with this supplemental funding. \\n \\n\\n   2. At the September 22nd public Council hearing, inform the Council about the status of  \\n\\n   various areas for which partner agencies have responsibility, including:  \\n\\n      a. Freeway and highway trash:  \\n\\n         i. The response of Caltrans to City inquiries regarding the geographic allocation of  \\n\\n         District 4 funding for trash pickup and litter abatement. Please determine, in  \\n\\n         particular, whether funds for cleanup on freeways in Santa Clara County appear  \\n\\n         proportionate (based on the population and lane miles) to that of other Bay Area  \\n\\n         counties, including any supplemental state funding from the most recent budget  \\n\\n         year. COUNCIL AGENDA: September 22, 2020 ITEM: 3.6 \\n\\n          ii. Whether the public response of Caltrans spokesperson Matt Rocco to Caltrans’  \\n\\n         inability to respond adequately to blight at the 280 /Almaden Caltrans-owned site  \\n\\n         in the September 11, 2020 Mercury News—that the agency “takes the health and  \\n\\n         safety of its employees very seriously” reflects whether the agency is actually  \\n\\n         declining to deploy Caltrans staff for cleanups for health-related reasons. Further  \\n\\n         determine—and invite Caltrans to explain—why the health risks for trash  \\n\\n         abatement outdoors should be considered more serious than the risks undertaken  \\n\\n         by the thousands of taxpaying San Jose residents working daily in busy kitchens,  \\n\\n         hospitals, laundries, and driving buses.  \\n \\n\\n(Item Continued on the Next Page) \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n City Council Draft Minutes/Synopsis September 22, 2020 \\n\\n City of San José Page 13 September 22, 2020 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n3.6 20-1090 Fiscal Recovery Update and Coronavirus Relief Fund Rebalancing. (Cont’d) \\n \\n\\n         iii. Whether San Jose Conservation Corps has additional capacity to undertake a  \\n\\n         larger share of the cleanup work on freeways, to compensate for shortfalls in  \\n\\n         Caltrans understaffing.  \\n\\n         iv. Whether San Jose Conservation Corps are being deployed disproportionately  \\n\\n         outside of the City of San Jose under the SJCC contract with the County of Santa  \\n\\n         Clara. Further determine Whether the City of San Jose can and should contract  \\n\\n         directly with the SJ Conservation Corps and other similar agencies to ensure more  \\n\\n         equitable service.  \\n\\n         v. Whether and when Santa Clara County will resume its probationer work  \\n\\n         program to clean county freeways, and whether that work is being allocated  \\n\\n         equitably in San Jose vis-à-vis other County locations.  \\n\\n      b. Railroads  \\n\\n         i. The anticipated Memorandum of Understanding governing scheduled cleanups  \\n\\n         by Union Pacific Railroad in San Jose, and the current cleaning schedule currently  \\n\\n         undertaken by UPRR.  \\n\\n         ii. The schedule for UPRR’s cleaning and clearing the large illegal dumping  \\n\\n         debris field in South San Jose near Bailey Road.  \\n\\n         iii. An update on code enforcement activity for adjacent properties, with an  \\n\\n         emphasis on properties with multiple violations.  \\n\\n         iv. An update on the use of technology and other strategies to help deter future  \\n\\n         illegal dumping, trespassing, and other activity at the Monterey Road at Emado  \\n\\n         Ave illegal dumping site.  \\n\\n      c. Creeks Waterway and clean-up collaboration of Valley Water with the City of San  \\n\\n         José, and planned outreach and cleaning efforts. \\n\\n   3. During the planned December Study Session, report to Council regarding:  \\n\\n      a. the status of long-overdue efforts to eliminate barriers to more widespread and  \\n\\n      frequently usage of the 311 app—including repeated sign-in requirements—and an  \\n\\n      update about how changes to the app have adversely affected public usage.  \\n\\n      b. the steps that the Emergency Operations Center is taking to verify the quality of  \\n\\n      the work and the effectiveness of our efforts—including that of private contractors—  \\n\\n      in cleaning and beautifying San Jose neighborhoods.  \\n\\n      c. whether opening public bidding to other tow operators outside the City of San Jose  \\n\\n      will enable more responsive service in clearing abandoned vehicles from our  \\n\\n      neighborhoods.  \\n\\n      d. an update on code enforcement activities, including how many staff are actively  \\n\\n      conducting code enforcement inspections and the percent of code enforcement  \\n\\n      services that have been fully restored to pre shelter-in-place levels. \\n\\n \\n\\n   This was addended with Memorandum from Vice Mayor Jones, dated 9/18/2020, to:  \\n\\n \\n\\n   Accept the recommendation submitted by Mayor Liccardo and Councilmembers Diep,  \\n\\n   Davis, and Jimenez and recommendation submitted by Councilmembers Esparza,  \\n\\n   Peralez, and Foley in directing City Manager to allocate funding towards expediting  \\n\\n   trash pickup and blight through various means equitably across the City. \\n \\n\\n(Item Continued on the Next Page) \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n City Council Draft Minutes/Synopsis September 22, 2020 \\n\\n City of San José Page 14 September 22, 2020 \\n\\n \\n3.6 20-1090 Fiscal Recovery Update and Coronavirus Relief Fund Rebalancing.

Direct staff to assess temporary COVID-19 related street closures, and explore \\nopportunities to close them permanently to motor vehicle traffic, as well as conduct a \\n\\ncitywide review of additional opportunities to modify streets for bicycle and pedestrian \\n\\nonly use. Report back to the Transportation and Environment Committee in early 2021. 2. When staff updates Council Policy 5-1: Transportation Analysis Policy look for ways to \\nintegrate the San José Better Bike Plan 2025 (PLAN) into that process in a way that \\n\\naccelerates PLAN implementation when new development projects are considered. 3. Aggressively pursue regional, state and federal dollars through the Measure B Active \\nTransportation funding, the State Active Transportation Program (ATP) and Affordable \\n\\nHousing Sustainable Community grant programs, the Highway Safety Improvement \\n\\nProgram (HSIP) and other grant programs to implement the PLAN. Further, as the Bay \\n\\nArea contemplates a regional transportation measure for 2022 or beyond, ensure that \\n\\nregional complete street and active transportation dollars remain a priority, and that San \\n\\nJosé is well-positioned to access that funding. \\n\\n(Item Continued on the Next Page) \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n City of San José Page 12  October 6, 2020 \\n5.1 (Cont’d.)  4. Continue to coordinate paving program --that is already supported by Measure T, \\nMeasure B and Senate Bill 1 funding -- with PLAN implementation in a way that \\n\\nprioritizes “low-stress” on-street bike facilities in addition to overall miles paved. 5. To advance the equity components of the PLAN focused on education and \\nencouragement programs that support a thriving and equitable bicycle culture in San \\n\\nJosé, staff should work with the Mayor’s Office of Strategic Partnerships, to identify and \\n\\npursue philanthropic funding. This effort should also be coordinated with our \\n\\ncommunity-based organizations and outreach partners. 6. Refocus Equity goal and metrics on improving the mobility of low-income residents by \\nprioritizing provision of safe, high-quality bike facilities serving high-need \\n\\nneighborhoods and destinations. 7. Reconsider how we could forge better continuous east-west connections--via high-quality \\nbuffered or protected bike lanes--from neighborhoods in East and South-Central San José \\n\\nto job and education centers in Downtown and North San José. \\n\\na. In particular, where appropriate studies reveal a safe approach for doing so, focus \\n\\nshould be given to finding high-quality east-west routes in the center of the City, \\n\\nbetween the cluster of proposed routes along Brokaw in the North, and Story in \\n\\nthe South. \\n\\nb. Prioritize those east-west connections in future capital expenditures. 8.

Educate Commission members on the importance of avoiding proposed maps that would result in \\n\\n\"stacking\", \"cracking\", or \"packing\" communities of color and thereby reducing their voice in municipal \\n\\ngovernance \\n\\nAND \\n\\nApprove the memorandum from Mayor Liccardo, dated October 9, 2020, as revised, to (1) Accept the \\n\\nCity Clerk’s recommendations; and (2) Adopt the reforms recommended by California Common Cause \\n\\nto maximize the diversity, openness and effectiveness of San José’s Redistricting Commission process \\n\\nas detailed below. 1. Hold an open application process: Let all San José residents apply to serve on the \\n\\ncommission. Construct an open and public process that makes applicants’ applications – their resumes \\n\\nand answers to short essay questions – known to the public. Create a website where members of the \\n\\npublic can submit public comment on applications. Require councilmembers to appoint someone from \\n\\nthe pool of people who apply from their district. \\uf0b7 CA Common Cause can provide useful examples of \\n\\napplications from other city and county redistricting commissions and consult on designing the \\n\\napplication process. 2. Eliminate conflicts of interest: Prohibit the appointment of an elected official\\'s \\n\\nfamily members, employees, current or past campaign staffers, or current or past campaign consultants; \\n\\ncurrent and past candidates and officeholders; registered city lobbyists; and major campaign donors (e.g. \\n\\n$500+). \\uf0b7 CA Common Cause can provide disqualifying conflict of interest criteria from other \\n\\nredistricting commissions. Disqualifying conflict of interest criteria of this kind are used by the state \\n\\ncommission and commissions in many cities and counties, including Menlo Park, Oakland, Los Angeles \\n\\nCounty, and San Diego County. 3. Ensure diversity on the commission: Require elected officials to \\n\\nmake their appointments \"provisional\" and public for a two-week period, so the City Clerk or City \\n\\nAttorney can provide an evaluation of whether the proposed appointees as a whole would compose a \\n\\ncommission that  \\n\\nis in fact racially/ethnically representative of the City. Require that the final appointments be made \\n\\ntogether at a noticed council meeting so that councilmembers can deliberate and make adjustments as \\n\\nneeded to ensure diversity. 4. Enable public input on commissioner selections before they are final: \\n\\nPermit the public to comment on the proposed commissioners during this provisional period. 5. Ban \\n\\nclosed-door, backroom communications: Increase independence and public trust by prohibiting  \\n\\n \\n\\n(Item Continued on the Next Page) \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n City of San José Page 13 October 27, /2020 \\n3.5 (Cont’d.)  \\n\\ncommissioners from having ex parte communications on redistricting. Such bans have been adopted by \\n\\nthe state commission and by several large cities in California, such as Long Beach and Sacramento. \\n\\nAdopt the provisions for California’s Citizens Redistricting Commission in state code section 8253.a3, \\n\\nwhich states: “Commission members and staff may not communicate with or receive communications \\n\\nabout redistricting matters from anyone outside of a public hearing. This paragraph does not prohibit \\n\\ncommunication between commission members, staff, legal counsel and consultants retained by the \\n\\ncommission.” Require all communication with commissioners concerning redistricting from elected \\n\\nofficials to be made orally during public comment at a commission meeting or in written comment \\n\\nsubmitted to the commission and published online. 6. Prevent interference with the commission’s work: \\n\\nPermit removal of a commissioner by the appointing elected official for good cause only (e.g. health \\n\\nproblems or moving out of San Jose) and with confirmation via a majority vote of the redistricting \\n\\ncommission. 7. Direct city staff to return with options for placing a charter amendment on the 2022 \\n\\nballot to create an independent redistricting commission, which would adopt council district boundaries \\n\\nin all future redistricting cycles. Staff should work with California Common Cause to identify best \\n\\npractices recommendations and model charter language from other California cities. \\n\\n(11-0.) \\n', 5, 3, 39, 'October 27, 2020', 1, 1, 0)\n",

Through the budget process, return to Council with a long-term strategy to fund staffing \\nfor Climate Smart San José implementation. This direction should align with prior \\n\\nCouncil direction to pursue philanthropic and regional, state, and federal funding – to \\n\\nensure our climate action work persists beyond the American Cities Climate Challenge \\n\\ngrant timeline. Work with the Mayor’s Office of Strategic Partnerships and other partners \\n\\nto identify and pursue foundation funding opportunities. 2. Pursue agency funding (BAAQMD, MTC, and CARB among others), and/or other \\nrevenue, to support a Transportation Demand Management coordinator to manage the \\n\\nCity employee transportation benefits program, and make campaigns to reduce single occupancy \\n\\ncommute trips within the City of San José’s employee population, and that of \\n\\nother San José based large employers. 3. Explore the development of a zero-emission neighborhood (ZEN) pilot focused on the \\nnexus of climate and equity where we can rapidly design and demonstrate whole \\n\\nneighborhood climate mitigation and adaptation strategies that are scalable in \\n\\nneighborhoods throughout the city. This effort should include: \\n\\na. Review of similar programs in other cities, funding sources, and impacts and \\n\\nlessons learned; \\n\\nb. An approach for community engagement that leverages the Climate Smart \\n\\nCommunity Engagement Roadmap adopted in June 2020 that includes equity-focused strategies for \\n\\nresidents, community-based organizations, and businesses; \\n\\nc. A neighborhood that has historically suffered disproportionate impact from \\n\\nenvironmental pollution, e.g., pollutants from a nearby industrial zone, airport, or \\n\\nfreeway; \\n\\n \\n\\n(Item Continued on the Next Page) \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n City of San José Page 13  November 17, 2020 \\n6.4 (Cont’d.) \\n \\n\\nd. Explicitly include the development of a neighborhood microgrid with sufficient \\n\\nscale to provide resilience against PSPS, wildfire, and other emergencies that \\n\\ninterrupt electricity transmission or distribution for a significant duration. 4. Explore leveraging the recent Climate Action Corps partnership with the Governor’s \\nOffice––announced earlier this Fall––to support community engagement and data \\n\\nmanagement efforts for Climate Smart San José implementation, and climate adaptation \\n\\nand mitigation strategies – like tree planting to address urban heat island effects and \\n\\nprovide green storm water infrastructure, and providing energy-savings measures for low-income \\n\\nfamilies. Further, collaborate with the Mayor’s Office to explore partnerships \\n\\nwith San José State University, local community colleges and career oriented high \\n\\nschools to offer opportunities for service learning students to volunteer and participate in \\n\\nlocal climate action work that is being led by the Climate Action Corps fellows \\n\\nthroughout the city. \\n\\n(11-0.) \\n\\n \\n', 4, 6, 42, 'November 17, 2020', 0, 1, 0)\n",
